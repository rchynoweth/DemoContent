# Python Imports with Databricks Repos

The traditional python imports have not been possible with the tradition notebook development in Databricks. It required users to use the `%run` command to execute other notebooks. 

With Repos in Databricks this is now possible. It simply requires writing a `.py` file of the module that you wish to import. Then create a notebook that you would like to execute as a job. Then you can easily import these modules to make the imports easier.
